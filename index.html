        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. HTML allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements such as tags and attributes.
 It is not considered a programming language as it cannot create dynamic functionality, but it is now an official web standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
 HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension, and a web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
 The language is widely used, with a lot of resources and a large community behind it, making it beginner-friendly and accessible.

        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to define the way a website looks.
 CSS allows you to control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your documents to your users with whatever design and layout you like.
 It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. HTML is the foundation of a site’s content and CSS makes up all of the visual design and aesthetics.
 CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular element or groups of elements on your web page.

    <p id="js">
        JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language that allows developers to add interactivity to web pages.
 JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS, and it can calculate, manipulate, and validate data.
 It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, alongside HTML and CSS, and is used to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and more.
 JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.
 It is also used for server-side development with the advent of Node.js, enabling developers to build full-stack applications using a single language.

    <p id="react">
        React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs).
 It is designed to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless".
 React is a tool for building UI components and uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render the UI when data changes.
 React allows developers to create reusable components, which can be combined to build complex applications.
 It is a front-end JavaScript library that is widely used for developing single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix.
 React adheres to the declarative programming paradigm, where developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes.
